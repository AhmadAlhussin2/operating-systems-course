For increasing the hit/miss ratio, I increased the number of duplicated items.
To do so, I printed a list with 1000 numbers, and on each iteration "i" I printed i/2.
The results are:
for 10 page frames:
Number of hits are: 499, Number of misses are: 501
Hit/Miss ratio: 0.996008
For 50 page frames:
Number of hits are: 499, Number of misses are: 501
Hit/Miss ratio: 0.996008
For 100 page frames:
Number of hits are: 499, Number of misses are: 501
Hit/Miss ratio: 0.996008

And, that is because when increasing the number of duplicated numbers, the chance of getting a hit is increased.
