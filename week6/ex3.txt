For comaring the threee algorithms I used the following input:

10 
0 1
0 2
0 4
0 6
0 8
11 8
11 6
11 4
11 2
11 1

And I chose quantum to be 3 in ex3 (first line of the input is 10 3 instead of 10)

The output from ex1:
Proccess #0 completion time is: 1 , the turn around time is: 1 , and the waiting time is: 0
Proccess #1 completion time is: 3 , the turn around time is: 3 , and the waiting time is: 1
Proccess #2 completion time is: 7 , the turn around time is: 7 , and the waiting time is: 3
Proccess #3 completion time is: 13 , the turn around time is: 13 , and the waiting time is: 7
Proccess #4 completion time is: 21 , the turn around time is: 21 , and the waiting time is: 13
Proccess #5 completion time is: 29 , the turn around time is: 18 , and the waiting time is: 10
Proccess #6 completion time is: 35 , the turn around time is: 24 , and the waiting time is: 18
Proccess #7 completion time is: 39 , the turn around time is: 28 , and the waiting time is: 24
Proccess #8 completion time is: 41 , the turn around time is: 30 , and the waiting time is: 28
Proccess #9 completion time is: 42 , the turn around time is: 31 , and the waiting time is: 30
The average turn around time is: 17.600000 , and the average waiting time is: 13.400000

The output from ex2:
Proccess #0 completion time is: 1 , the turn around time is: 1 , and the waiting time is: 0
Proccess #1 completion time is: 3 , the turn around time is: 3 , and the waiting time is: 1
Proccess #2 completion time is: 7 , the turn around time is: 7 , and the waiting time is: 3
Proccess #3 completion time is: 13 , the turn around time is: 13 , and the waiting time is: 7
Proccess #4 completion time is: 34 , the turn around time is: 34 , and the waiting time is: 26
Proccess #5 completion time is: 42 , the turn around time is: 31 , and the waiting time is: 23
Proccess #6 completion time is: 26 , the turn around time is: 15 , and the waiting time is: 9
Proccess #7 completion time is: 20 , the turn around time is: 9 , and the waiting time is: 5
Proccess #8 completion time is: 16 , the turn around time is: 5 , and the waiting time is: 3
Proccess #9 completion time is: 14 , the turn around time is: 3 , and the waiting time is: 2
The average turn around time is: 12.100000 , and the average waiting time is: 7.900000

The output from ex3:
Proccess #0 completion time is: 1 , the turn around time is: 1 , and the waiting time is: 0
Proccess #1 completion time is: 3 , the turn around time is: 3 , and the waiting time is: 1
Proccess #2 completion time is: 13 , the turn around time is: 13 , and the waiting time is: 9
Proccess #3 completion time is: 16 , the turn around time is: 16 , and the waiting time is: 10
Proccess #4 completion time is: 40 , the turn around time is: 40 , and the waiting time is: 32
Proccess #5 completion time is: 42 , the turn around time is: 31 , and the waiting time is: 23
Proccess #6 completion time is: 37 , the turn around time is: 26 , and the waiting time is: 20
Proccess #7 completion time is: 38 , the turn around time is: 27 , and the waiting time is: 23
Proccess #8 completion time is: 27 , the turn around time is: 16 , and the waiting time is: 14
Proccess #9 completion time is: 28 , the turn around time is: 17 , and the waiting time is: 16
The average turn around time is: 19.000000 , and the average waiting time is: 14.800000


In this specific case we can notice that shortest job first algorithm performs better than the other two algorithms ( in terms of average waiting time and average turn around time ).
In addition, we can notice that "first come, first served (FCFS)" algorithm performed better than round robin algorithm.
However, it is not always the case. Sometimes round robin algorithm may perform better than the other two.
In conclusion, there is no algorithm better than the other since each one has its usecases;
