The physical address is the real(physical) location of an address in memory. However the virtual address get generated from the CPU during the program runtime. 
Moreover, the virtually address does not physically exists, unlike the physical address which is a location in memory.
Also, the virtual address is used to access the physical address, since the physical address is not directly accessable.
The physical address is computed by a hardware called Memory Manegment Unit, but the virtual addres does not get computed since it is virtual and does not really exist.
