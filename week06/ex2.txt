We can notice that shortest job next algorithm gave better results in terms of average turn around time and average waiting time
So, in this case we can say that shortest job next performed better than first come, first served algorithm.
However, there might be some cases where the performance of first come first served algorithm is better than shortest job next.
This case could happen when a lot of short proccess block a olng proccess for a very long time.
